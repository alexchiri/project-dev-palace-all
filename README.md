# Project Dev Palace

Every folder in this repo contains a Dockerfile which builds a Docker image I use as a development environment for a specific purpose. `basic` is setting the basic set of tooling for all the other images.

There are some leftovers from the time I was using these images to create VMs in WSL2 programmatically.
